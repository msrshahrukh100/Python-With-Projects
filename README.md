## [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPCm0ddb3NQ&list=PLcVVozOxWVxpelDDwQ_hhDBBPkYF7TBSb)
Learn to make a very simple and basic chatbot. The concepts which you'll learn while making this chatbot are -
1. Printing statements in Python
1. Assigning values to variables
1. Taking User Input
1. Datatypes in Python
1. Typecasting in Python
1. Mathematical Operations in Python

### Printing statements in Python 3
+ `print("abc")`
+ Printing multiple values - `print("abc", "def", "fgh")`
+ Specifing the ending string - `print("abc", end=" ")`
+ Printing strings as is, using triple quoted strings - `print(''' your statements here ''')`

### Taking user input in Python 3
+ `name = input("What's your name? ")`

### Datatypes in Python 3
+ If `number = 10` then `print(type(number))` will print `<class 'int'>` that is number is of integer datatype
+ If `number = 10.23` then `print(type(number))` will print `<class 'float'>` that is number is of float datatype
+ If `number = "One hundered"` then `print(type(number))` will print `<class 'str'>` that is number is of sring datatype

### Typecasting in Python 3
+ To integer - `int(number)`
+ To float - `int(number)`
+ To string - `int(number)`
+ Taking integer user input - `number = int(input("Enter a number"))`

### Mathematical Operations in Python 3
+ Multiplication - `print(3*4)` will print `12`
+ Integer Division - `print(5/4)` will print `1.25`
+ Finding remainder - `print(5%4)` will print `1`
+ Finding quotient - `print(10//4)` will print `2`
